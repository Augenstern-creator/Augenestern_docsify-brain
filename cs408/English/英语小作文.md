## 3.1、中华文化

**有关中华文化，介绍人的、地点的、介绍书的、介绍电影的，都可以统一为介绍《孔子》**

- 介绍人，就介绍孔子
- 介绍地点，就介绍孔庙
- 介绍书，就介绍孔子这本书
- 介绍电影，就介绍孔子这部电影

​		Chinese traditional culture is broad and profound, whether it is material four great inventions or ideology debate。

​		I would like to highlight `Confucius (孔子)/  Confucian Temple (孔庙)/ Analects (论语) `。Being a great thinker, educator and founder of confucianism (孔子学说)，Confucius is an ancient sage during the spring and autumn period。His words and life story were recorded by his students in the "Analets" (论语)。No scholar could truly understand this long-standing culture or the inner world of the ancient Chinese without `this book / understanding Confucius / confucianism` (这本书 / 了解孔子 / 孔子学说)

​		This is perhaps why Confucian thought （儒家思想） in the 21st century still remains the interest of not only the Chinese people but also in other parts of the world。

---

​		中国传统文化博大精深，无论是四大发明还是精神层面上的百家争鸣。

​		我想重点强调一下`孔子/孔庙/论语`，孔子是伟大的思想家、教育家和儒家的创始人，是春秋时期的古圣人。他的文字和生平故事被他的学生记录在“论语”中。没有`这本书 `学者不能够真正理解这种悠久的文化或古代中国人的内心世界。

​		这也许就是为什么儒家思想在21世纪仍然不仅受到中国人民的兴趣，而且在世界其他地区仍然受到关注的原因。







## 3.2、投诉

> 投诉物品

​		Dear sir or madam ，I am a customer（顾客） who bought an electronic dictionary，I , to be frank , am writing this letter in order to express my dissatisfaction about the dictionary。

​		I received the dictionary this morning，Unfortunately, there were several problems with it。The dictionary , ==to begin with==, has so many scratches that I think you had sent me a used one by mistake. ==In addition== , I have found it does not work properly now。I hope you can deal with my complaint seriously Either a replacement or a refund will be acceptable to me。

​		尊敬的先生或女士，我是购买电子词典的客户（顾客），坦率地说，我写这封信是为了表达我对词典的不满。

​		我今天早上收到字典，可惜里面有几个问题。首先，字典有很多划痕，我想你错误地寄给我一个用过的。另外，我发现它现在不是很好用。希望你能认真处理我的投诉，无论是换货还是退款，我都可以接受。



> 投诉服务

​		Last Monday， I went to your store to look for an outfit。When I asked an available salesperson for help in finding `my size / the toilet(厕所)` ，she informed me that she was busy and that I would have to find it myself。I explained the reason why I came to her was that I could not find it。She then said in a rude tone that if I failed to find the product，there was no it in the market ，which made me outraged 。Their services has not benefited from the saying, "the customer is king"。

​		In the end ，I hope the problem could be solved as quickly as possible。I also hope to draw the attention of the authorities concerned。



​		上周一去你们店里找衣服。当我请求一个闲暇的销售人员帮忙找到`我的尺码/厕所`，她告诉我她很忙，我必须自己去找。我解释说我来找她的原因是因为我找不到，然而她用粗鲁的语气说，如果我找不到产品，市场上就没有，这让我很生气。他们的服务并没有体现"客户为王"这句话。

​		最后，希望问题能尽快解决。我也希望引起有关当局的注意。
